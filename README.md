# Render Commander

Blender add‑on for background rendering with multi‑GPU support.

This addon provides a simple and intuitive UI to configure a set of common render settings.
It compiles all selected options into a temporary Python file, which is then attached to a Blender command-line render execution.
This approach enables fast, efficient, and fully automated background renders without manual setup.

## Features

### Device-Parallel Rendering

The addon uses its own render-device selection and automates your rendering workflow by launching a separate background Blender instance for each enabled compute device. It also supports rendering across multiple back‑ends simultaneously.

### Render Presets & Overrides

Tweak resolution, samples, output paths, and more, without altering your original scene. Save and reuse presets for different project stages (draft, final, client review, etc.).

### External Blend Files

Render scenes stored in external `.blend` files without opening them in Blender.
Preview scene settings, apply overrides, and start renders directly from the add-on panel.

### Advanced Options

- **Desktop Notifications** – Get notified when a render job finishes.

- **System Power Control** – Keeps your PC awake during renders and can automatically sleep or shut down once all jobs are complete.

- **Custom Blender Executables** – Define custom Blender paths to use different versions or builds.

- **Append Python Scripts** – Attach your own Python scripts to render jobs for logging, post-processing, or pipeline integration.
